Message Properties Generator
===========================================================

Overview
===========================================================
The purpose of this tool is to simplify the process of 
internationalisation of Java applcations which use message properties.
This is done by creating centralized place to store all translations
for each resource key and each message properties file.
For maximum ease of use to the user, the centralized storage will be
an excel file.

Application Environment
===========================================================
The application will be used from two places:
	- a console
	- through an ant task
	
When it's run as a console application the user should choose
between TO_PROPERTIES and TO_EXCEL run mode.
When it's run as an ant task the only supported mode must be TO_PROPERTIES.

Input Parameters
===========================================================
The supported input parameters must be:
	- Mode - (TO_PROPERTIES (default) | TO_EXCEL)
	- Excel file path
	- Message properties directory
	- Target Encoding (optional, default UTF-8. This will be added later if we have time)
	
Output
===========================================================
The output depends on the mode parameter as:
	* If the mode is TO_EXCEL the output will be a single excel file, which contains
worksheet for each .properties group, and in each worksheet contains data for each translation.
	* If the mode is TO_PROPERTIES the output is a group of .properties files
one file for each language supported in the excel file.

Excel Structure
===========================================================
Let's have this file structure:
	/i18n/Messages.properties
	/i18n/Messages_en.properties
	/i18n/Messages_fr.properties
	/i18n/Messages_Model_en.properties
	/i18n/Messages_Model_es.properties
	/i18n/Messages_Model_fr.properties

The the generated Excel file should have the following structure:
	- It should contain two worksheets named: Messages and Messages_Model
	- The Messages worksheet should have these columns: Key, Default, EN, FR
	- The Messages_Model worksheet should have these columns: Key, EN, ES, FR
	- Each worksheet should contain all message keys, from all files of it's group, sorted by name
Note the following:
	- We don't force consistency over the different file groups
		(we don't have Messages_es.properties but we have Messages_Model_es.properties)
	- The translations columns are sorted by language name,
		except the Default language which must always be first if exits

Message Properties Generation
===========================================================
Having an excel file with the structure describe the tool should
generate group of message properties by:
	- having one file for each language of a worksheet with the proper naming.
	- in each file are included only the keys for which we have translation
	- if exists the Default language should contain all posible keys (even if there is not translation for them)
