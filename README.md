Message properties generator
------

This Java tool creates message properties from Excel documents and vice versa.
Check the example Excel document for the formatting.
If you have the properties files already created the tool will generate a Excel file from them. Also it will sort the key-value pairs and mark the differences (if any) in the properties files.

Prerequisites
------
* You must import Apache POI library version 3.6 in to the classpath.

TODO
------
* Add Ivy dependency manager.
